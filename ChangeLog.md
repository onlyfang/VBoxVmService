### 2010-12-24 Release 2.1 "Reindeer"

* A new option has been added to the .INI-File, enabling the individual configuration of 
* the VRDP-ports of virtual machines for remote administration purposes.


### Changes since version rel20080223

* For the helper application "bat2exe.exe" (by Fatih Kodak) was getting false positives on several antivirus systems, it has been substituted by "bcompile.exe", which should work without further problems. The sourcecode of "bcompile.exe" can be found underneath the "src\c#\"-subdirectory. For it had to be a quick solution, there is a small issue with undeleted temp-files piling up in the temp-folder. This will be taken care of in the next upcoming release.

* I added a "StartupMethod" flag to the .INI-file to support as well VRDP and SDL (the VM- controller of the OSE (Open Source Edition)). Thanks to 'Technologov' at the VirtualBox Forums for triggering that! Yet, SDL support is still sort of buggy and needs some more time and review...
