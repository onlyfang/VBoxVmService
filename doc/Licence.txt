Licence
----------------------------------------------------------------

All the tools, all the sourcecode and just everything we used was 

"free to use by anybody", so VBoxVmService is too, of course.

Since we do not take any responsibility for any eventual damage 

using this software might possibly do to your system(s) and since 

we are not legal guys, let's just call it a "free as in 'free beer' 

licence": If you like it, you are welcome to use it. And if you 

don't, just don't sue us. :-)
